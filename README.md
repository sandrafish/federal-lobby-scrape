# federal-lobby-scrape
This is a Python/Pandas script to scrape the [federal lobby site](https://lda.senate.gov/system/public/) for filings from a specific state. 

The first block of code came from a couple of queries via ChatGTP, complete with most of the commenting. Google also provided suplemental JSON unpacking.

You'll need your own API key (see the main page linked above), and you'll probably want to change the state code and maybe the year.

Ping me if this doesn't work. Not the greatest at GitHub doh.
